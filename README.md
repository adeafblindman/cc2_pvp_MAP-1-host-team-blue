How to import a save file

Find the saved_games folder
C:\Users\enter your user\AppData\Roaming\Carrier Command 2

Or if that doesn't work you can manually navigate to the folder. To find your game's save file first head into your appdata's folder. You can do this by doing (windows key + R) then entering %appdata%


If you're the recipient of the file you want to open the saved_games folder and create a new folder and give it a name.Paste the XML save file into the folder you created.

Then head back to the persistent_data XML file. Pick any slot that's empty and fill in the time with 1. For display_name enter the name you want displayed on the load screen. For save_name enter the name of the folder with the save file. Make sure to save before exiting the file.
